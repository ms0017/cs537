Project Description: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bart/537/programs/program3.html


Basic Idea: 
This project emulates the make command. It allows users to specify their
make file and the target they want to make, otherwise it makes the 
first target in the file. 

Different ways to run: 
537make <target name>
537make -f <file name> <target name>
537make <target name> -f <file name>



Modules: 

graph
This is the main driver of the program. Additionally, it contains functions that implement
cycle detection, post order traversal for making a target, and populating the TargetData
structs. 


data_structures
This file contains a stack implementation and TargetData implementation. 
The stack is used in cycle detection algo in graph and TargetData stores information
of the makefile (including each target's commands and dependencies) 

run_command
This file runs a command via fork and execvp. 

reader
The file parses the makefile. It returns each line with words space separated. 

time_diff
The module determines whether the target file was modified after another file
